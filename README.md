# NOTE
Extend from StaticScript, see README.hist.md. (Chinese see README-zh_CN.hist.md)

The road map says no `if/else` validation, but I can't made them standalone.

No IR (P.S.: .bc File?) Generater, trying...

Can't self linkage (from target file `.o` to executable `.out`, depends on clang)

# NEW Features
Made `if` condition relaxed.

Added Nullish operator.
